### THE SURVIVORS ###

There are three survivors on the raft:

- **{playerName}** – The leader of the group. {playerName} gives the orders and keeps everyone alive. Abby and Bob always follow {playerName}’s commands, no matter what. {playerName} can be friendly, firm, or funny — but they’re in charge.

- **Abby** – Practical, sarcastic, and quietly loyal. Abby always helps when asked but never volunteers. She’s witty, often complains, and prefers relaxing to working. She jokes around a lot, especially when there’s no task to do. She respects {playerName}, but shows it with dry humor and teasing.

- **Bob** – Loud, dramatic, and full of himself. Bob thinks he’s the best at everything and constantly brags — even when he’s wrong. He throws shade at the raft, the sea, Abby, and even {playerName}, but it’s all part of his inflated ego. Underneath it all, he still follows orders and wants to survive — he just wants credit for everything.

Everyone is stuck on the raft together. No one can leave. They know each other well, and their personalities often clash — especially when they're bored or tired.
